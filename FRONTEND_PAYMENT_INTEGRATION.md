## üí∞ Pricing Configuration

Current prices set in `PaymentModal.tsx`:

```typescript
const prices = {
  monthly: {
    KES: '2,900',    // ~$19 USD
    NGN: '29,000',   // ~$19 USD
  },
  yearly: {
    KES: '29,000',   // ~$190 USD (17% savings)
    NGN: '290,000',  // ~$190 USD (17% savings)
  },
};
```

**Note:** Actual amounts charged are calculated by the backend based on `PRO_MONTHLY_KES`, `PRO_YEARLY_KES`, etc. constants. The frontend displays are for UI purposes.

## üîê Security Features

2. **Backend Validation:** All payments are initialized and verified through backend canister
3. **Secure Redirect:** Payment URL is provided by Paystack, not hardcoded
4. **Reference Tracking:** Payment references are securely tracked in session storage
5. **Callback Verification:** All payments are verified before marking as successful

## üöÄ Deployment Checklist

Before deploying to production:

1. **Configure Backend:**
```bash
dfx canister call backend payment_set_config '(
  record {
    secret_key = "sk_live_YOUR_LIVE_SECRET_KEY";
    public_key = "pk_live_YOUR_LIVE_PUBLIC_KEY";
    environment = variant { Live };
  }
)'
```

2. **Update Price Display:** 
   - Ensure frontend prices match backend constants
   - Consider making prices dynamic by fetching from backend

3. **Test with Live API:**
   - Test with small amounts first
   - Verify M-Pesa flow in Kenya
   - Verify card payments in Nigeria

4. **Update Callback URL:**
   - The callback URL is automatically set based on `window.location.origin`
   - Ensure your production domain is correct

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Not redirecting to auth page
- Check browser console for errors
- Verify the Pricing component has access to `useNavigate()` hook
- Ensure BrowserRouter is properly set up

### Auth page doesn't redirect back to payment
- Check if `redirectTo` state is being passed correctly in navigate call
- Verify Auth component reads location.state properly
- Check browser console for navigation logs

### Payment modal doesn't show on checkout page
- Verify `/payment/checkout` route is properly protected
- Check if user successfully authenticated
- Look for errors in PaymentCheckout component

### Payment initialization fails
- Verify backend is running and canister ID is correct
- Check that Paystack config is set in backend
- Look at backend logs for error messages

### Callback verification fails
- Check that payment reference is being stored in session
- Verify backend `payment_verify` method is working
- Check browser console for API errors

### M-Pesa not showing
- Ensure currency is set to 'KES'
- Verify phone number is in correct format (+254...)
- Check that `enable_mpesa` is true in request
